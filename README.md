# inhabitent

inhabitent is a wordpress project designed by RED-academy.

Technologies used in this project are:
wordpress, github, javascript - es6 and beyond, es2015, sass, css, html, php, font-awesome 

Inhabitent is spelt wrong in a lot of this project.  It is by design.  If you didn't get that, you have no sense of humour.

What I have learned in this project:

Wordpress is not for the average internet user.

I have learned taxonomies are similar to classes and arrays they are most useful in conjunction with Wordpress especially when creating custom post-types that you want to separate by category.

Building single page websites on your computer that never needs to be shared with the world is a lot easier and straight-forward than Wordpress.
