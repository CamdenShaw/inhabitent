# About
Inhabitent is spelt wrong in a lot of this project.  It is by design.  If you didn't get that, you have no sense of humour.

## What I Have Learned in This Project

I learned how to download a starter theme for wordpress then modify it both in the wordpress backend and in the code itself.  We added custom taxonomies, custom plugins, custom post-types and a custom archive.

Wordpress is a very involved tool that makes building multi-page websites faster and easier to manage - especially when all the coding is done and the project can be handed over to the client.  Even if the client has minimal knowledge about computers, once the theme is built for them they will have no trouble adding content to the site themselves.

That being said, Wordpress is not for the average internet user.  It still needs to be set up by someone who knows what they're doing.

I have learned taxonomies are similar to classes and arrays they are most useful in conjunction with Wordpress especially when creating custom post-types that you want to separate by category.

Building single page websites on your computer that never needs to be shared with the world is a lot easier and straight-forward than Wordpress.
